# minor_project
 Sem 4 Minor project on Heart disease prediction model using machine learning

folder description
1. ecg graph(jpg) : it contains ECG reports in jpg format for those who want to feed direct graph to our ml model for the prediction can train the image processing on this data.
2. Literature survey Minor project : it contains the research paper for literature survey.
3. Processed dataset : it contains processed dataset in csv format with 74 attributes for Cleveland, long beach, Switzerland, and Hungary.
4. Project Presentation : it contains all the files, pdfs, word files and ppts for college evaluation and presentation.
5. Raw UCI dataset : it contains all the files from uci site from where we have taken the dataset --- --- ---https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/
6. ecg data.zip : it contains (approx.) 1 millon records for 12 probes, 10 second ECG test report in form of 188 attributes.



# Instructions
->  Every one have to analyse the "heart-disease.txt" file in Raw UCI dataset folder.\n
-> Study about each attributr out of 76 given attributes in the original data set and pich the most reasonable and important attributes.\n
->study different types of classification  model and try it on the filtered attributes.\n
### note -> create a seperate branch with ur name and pull request after achieving certain goal


# To Do
-> Prepare original dataset for  feature selection\n
-> feature selection\n
-> feature extraction\n
-> model selection\n
-> performance analysis\n
-> model deployment\n
-> web app development\n
-> research paper writing (writing  part)\n
